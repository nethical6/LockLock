## How It Works

1. **Accessibility Service Monitoring**
   LockLock uses Android’s Accessibility Services to detect when locked apps are opened and immediately blocks access unless the correct password is entered. This approach allows it to work on virtually any app without requiring root access.

2. **Device Admin for Anti-Uninstall**
   By requesting Device Administrator rights, LockLock prevents unauthorized users from uninstalling the app without your permission, adding an extra layer of security.

3. **Password & Bruteforce Protection**
   LockLock enforces a password lock screen for protected apps, and intelligently blocks repeated incorrect attempts by temporarily locking access, keeping your data safe from hacking attempts.

4. **Offline Privacy**
   Since LockLock does not use the internet at all, your passwords and lock data remain strictly on your device — no servers, no cloud syncing, no data leaks.
